  <summary>Books</summary>
    <ol> 
         <li><a href="https://amzn.to/2N0dzNb" target="blank">Clean Architecture</a> - by applying universal rules of software architecture, you can dramatically improve developer productivity throughout the life of any software system. Now, building upon the success of his best-selling books Clean Code and The Clean Coder, legendary software craftsman Robert C. Martin (“Uncle Bob”) reveals those rules and helps you apply them.</li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://amzn.to/2JIjOrz" target="blank">Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship</a> - even bad code can function. But if code isn’t clean, it can bring a development organization to its knees. Every year, countless hours and significant resources are lost because of poorly written code. But it doesn’t have to be that way.
      </li>
      <li><a href="https://amzn.to/2L6mcE0" target="blank">Code Complete</a> - widely considered one of the best practical guides to programming, Steve McConnell’s original CODE COMPLETE has been helping developers write better software for more than a decade. </li>
      <li><a href="https://amzn.to/2MlI3wW" target="blank">Cracking the Coding Interview</a> - learn how to uncover the hints and hidden details in a question, discover how to break down a problem into manageable chunks, develop techniques to unstick yourself when stuck, learn (or re-learn) core computer science concepts, and practice on 189 interview questions and solutions.</li>
      <li><a href="https://amzn.to/2NPhvRX" target="blank">The Clean Coder</a> - this book is packed with practical advice–about everything from estimating and coding to refactoring and testing. It covers much more than technique: It is about attitude. Martin shows how to approach software development with honor, self-respect, and pride; work well and work clean; communicate and estimate faithfully; face difficult decisions with clarity and honesty; and understand that deep knowledge comes with a responsibility to act.</li>
      <li><a href='http://amzn.to/2BNciX2' target="blank">The Complete Software Developer's Career Guide</a> - early in his software developer career, John Sonmez discovered that technical knowledge alone isn't enough to break through to the next income level - developers need "soft skills" like the ability to learn new technologies just in time, communicate clearly with management and consulting clients, negotiate a fair hourly rate, and unite teammates and coworkers in working toward a common goal.</li>
      <li><a href="https://amzn.to/39O7hMm" target="blank">The Pragmatic Programmer</a> - Dave Thomas and Andy Hunt wrote the first edition of this influential book in 1999 to help their clients create better software and rediscover the joy of coding. Topics range from personal responsibility and career development to architectural techniques for keeping your code flexible and easy to adapt and reuse. </li>
      <li>
      <a href="https://amzn.to/37JCaQj" target="blank">The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering</a> - Few books on software project management have been as influential and timeless as The Mythical Man-Month. With a blend of software engineering facts and thought-provoking opinions, Fred Brooks offers insight for anyone managing complex projects. 
      </li>
      <li>
      <a href="https://amzn.to/2s7BKEk" target="blank">Soft Skills: The software developer's life manual</a> - Soft Skills: The software developer's life manual is a unique guide, offering techniques and practices for a more satisfying life as a professional software developer. In it, developer and life coach John Sonmez addresses a wide range of important "soft" topics.
      </li>
      <li>
      <a href="https://amzn.to/35DDaUU" target="blank">HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites</a> - Introduces HTML and CSS in a way that makes them accessible to everyone―hobbyists, students, and professionals―and it’s full-color throughout.
      Utilizes information graphics and lifestyle photography to explain the topics in a simple way that is engaging.
      </li>
      <li>
      <a href="https://amzn.to/2FvYl0e" target="blank">Head First Design Patterns: A Brain-Friendly Guide</a> - At any given moment, someone struggles with the same software design problems you have. And, chances are, someone else has already solved your problem. This edition of Head First Design Patterns shows you the tried-and-true, road-tested patterns used by developers to create functional, elegant, reusable, and flexible software.
      </li>
      <li>
      <a href="https://amzn.to/2T4zrNk" target="blank">Grokking Algorithms: An illustrated guide for programmers and other curious people</a> - Grokking Algorithms is a fully illustrated, friendly guide that teaches you how to apply common algorithms to the practical problems you face every day as a programmer. You'll start with sorting and searching and, as you build up your skills in thinking algorithmically, you'll tackle more complex concerns such as data compression and artificial intelligence.
       </li>
      <li><a href="https://amzn.to/37KZsFq" target="blank">A Smarter Way to Learn JavaScript. The new tech-assisted approach that requires half the effort</a> - Learning JavaScript is hell because of two problems.
I remove the problems, and you start having fun.
The first problem is retention. You remember only ten or twenty percent of what you read. That spells failure. To become fluent in a computer language, you have to retain pretty much everything.</li>
<li>
  <a href="https://amzn.to/2N3fnqX" target="blank">Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software</a> - What do flashlights, the British invasion, black cats, and seesaws have to do with computers? In CODE, they show us the ingenious ways we manipulate language and invent new means of communicating with each other. And through CODE, we see how this ingenuity and our very human compulsion to communicate have driven the technological innovations of the past two centuries.
</li>

<li>
<a href="https://amzn.to/2ZYNDsJ" target="blank">Eloquent JavaScript: A Modern Introduction to Programming</a> - JavaScript lies at the heart of almost every modern web application, from social apps like Twitter to browser-based game frameworks like Phaser and Babylon. Though simple for beginners to pick up and play with, JavaScript is a flexible, complex language that you can use to build full-scale applications.
